# Class 14: Psychological Safety

## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Psychological safety is crucial for fostering a positive and productive team environment.
Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are:

1. **Open Communication**: Teams thrive in an environment where open and transparent communication is encouraged.
   Members feel psychologically safe when they can express their thoughts, ideas, concerns, and even mistakes without
   fear of judgment or reprisal. Establishing clear channels for communication, active listening, and fostering a
   culture where every team member's voice is valued contribute to an atmosphere of psychological safety.

2. **Trust and Respect**: Building trust among team members is foundational to psychological safety. When individuals
   trust that their teammates, they are more likely to take risks, share innovative ideas, and collaborate effectively.
   Leaders play a crucial role in cultivating trust by modeling trustworthy behavior, acknowledging accomplishments,
   and ensuring fair and respectful treatment within the team.

3. **Supportive Leadership**: Leadership plays a pivotal role in creating and maintaining psychological safety. Leaders
   who demonstrate empathy, provide constructive feedback, and empower their team members create an environment where
   individuals feel supported and valued. Supportive leadership involves acknowledging and addressing concerns, fostering
   a growth mindset, and actively working to remove obstacles that hinder team members' success. When leaders prioritize
   psychological safety, team members are more likely to feel confident in taking initiative and contributing to the
   team's success.

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety

A previous professional setting that disregarded my psychological safety was during my enlistment in the US Army. There are
many settings to draw from during this period, but one such setting that sticks with me is a time a leader approached me saying:
"You know, black people aren't meant to be doing this job that you are doing. It's natural selection. You all lack the
mental capacity to do these things." This incident marked an extreme example of a psychologically unsafe environment.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have a transformative impact on both their company and team members.
Such teams cultivate a culture where individuals feel empowered to voice their opinions, share ideas, and take calculated risks
without fear of reprisal. This fosters innovation and creativity, as team members collaborate more openly and explore new approaches
to problem-solving. The positive, supportive environment enhances overall team cohesion, trust, and communication, leading to
improved job satisfaction and well-being among team members. From a company perspective, these psychologically safe teams contribute
to increased productivity, employee retention, and a positive organizational culture, ultimately driving sustained success and adaptability
in the dynamic business landscape.
