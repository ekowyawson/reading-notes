## JavaScript Canvas

### What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to achieve?

The `<canvas>` element allows developers to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

### What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

It is important to close the `</canvas>` element because all content within the element
is considered **fallback** content and will not render/show unless the browser does not
support `<canvas>`; therefore, anything after the opening tag will not show.

### Explain what the getContext() method does

The `getContext()` method returns a render context object.
