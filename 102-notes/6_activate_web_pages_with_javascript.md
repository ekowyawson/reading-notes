# Activate Web Pages With JavaScript

![Alt text](../images/js_image.png)

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile, and dynamically-typed programming language primarily used for web development. It is primarily used in creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It is important to note: do note mistake JavaScript with Java, they are two completely different programming languages.

A brief history on JavaScript. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, developed for `Netscape 2` (a now obsolete web browser that was popular back in the day), and became the `ECMA-262` standard in 1997[1]. It is now maintained by the Mozilla foundation.

Now let us answer some questions regarding JavaScript.

## What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data. They act as containers for values, which can be *numbers, strings, objects, functions,* or any type of data allowable (JavaScript is considered loosely typed).

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

Declaring a variable in JavaScript means to give the variable a name using using one of three keywords: `var`, `let`, or `const`. The choice of keyword determines the variable's scope (*the block level in which the variable can be read, such as globally throughout the script or within a specific function*) and mutability (*the ability to redeclare the variable*).

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

The assignment operator is a singular equal sign `=` and it assigns a value to a variable.

## What is information received from the user called?

Information received from a user is called an `input`.
