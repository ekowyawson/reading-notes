# Programming With JavaScript

In JavaScript, as well as most other scripting languages, code is read by the computer from top to bottom, executing each line in succession. However, there are some instances where the script will tell the computer to jump back to a previous position and either re-run a block of code, or jump back to a declared, but never run code and runt it. This concept is known as the `Control Flow`.

Control Flows can consist of conditional statements, loops, recursions, etcetera.
