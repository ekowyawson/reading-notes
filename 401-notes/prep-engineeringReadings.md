# Prep: Engineering Readings

## How to think like a programmer

I am a programmer. Also, I always use frameworks as a starting point.

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have quite a bit of experience in a related field and with that knowledge, I can accurately  say that I bring a unique
ability to solve unconventional problems that most would mark as unsolvable. Coupled with that ability, is an unwavering
dedication to accomplishing career (or company) goals and missions.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

When I find myself stuck on a challenging piece of code, logic, or feature, here are three strategies I can implement to help me get "un-stuck":

1. **Take a Break and Refresh:**
   Sometimes, stepping away from the problem for a short break can provide a fresh perspective. I can go for a walk, grab a snack, or engage in a different task for a while.
   This break can help clear my mind and allow me to return with a new outlook, potentially spotting errors or alternative solutions that were previously overlooked.

2. **Rubber Duck Debugging:**
   I can Explain the problem or my thought process to someone else, even if it's an inanimate object like a rubber duck. This technique often helps me articulate the problem
   and can lead to a better understanding of the issue. As I explain the code or the problem aloud, I might identify the source of the difficulty and come up with potential solutions.

3. **Break the Problem Down:**
   Complex issues can be overwhelming, so I try breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. I focus on solving one sub-problem at a time. This modular approach
   allows me to address each component independently, making the overall task seem less daunting. Once I solve the smaller pieces, I can integrate them into the larger solution.
