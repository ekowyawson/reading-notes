## The "Growth Mindset"

A **growth mindset** is a manner of thinking that beckons the thinker to continuously self-improve, through hard work and dedication, regardless of the thinker's level of proficiency on a subject. The growth mindset is in direct contrast to a `fixed mindset`, in which an individual believes he/she/they are at the peak of his/her/their abilities and intelligence on a particular subject.

The **growth mindset** enables the thinker to always search for new and innovative ways to solve problems, rather than relying on an archaic, *"This is how it has always been done"* mentality. This **fixed mindset** thinking can cripple a person or organization's innovation, ingenuity, and ultimately, their growth.

## Three reminders to keep a growth mindset

* **Embrace Challenges**: A problem may be solved today, but may evolve tomorrow so stay open-minded and ready for a challenge.
   > Never run from a challenge
* **Hard Work and Effort**: Maintaining a growth mindset cannot be achieved without putting in effort.
   > Put in the work
* **Failures Are Lessons**: Do not let failure prevent you from attempting difficult tasks.
   > You only fail when you quit

## About Me

Greetings fellow traveler! My name is Ekow (pronounced 'echo') Yawson. I am a US Army Veteran, father, and your favorite IT guy. I currently reside in Maryland, so all of you West Coasters bear with me regarding the time difference :). Tinkering and solving complex problems is my most cherished past-time, which has translated well into my fledgling IT career. I have used YouTube and random online courses to become fairly proficient in JavaScript, Python, and BASH scripting. I've also built a few websites and web applications using different frameworks. My goal in this course (and subsequent courses here at Code Fellows) is merge my raw skills with the institutional knowledge required to be a fully qualified developer.
